*This is a poem I wrote in 2016, after reading Nick Bostrom's [Are You Living in a Simulation?](https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation) paper for the first time.*

------

I can’t fall asleep again, so I think about how 
we’re probably a simulation: that the here, the now 
isn’t even real - not how we think at least - 
it’s a vicious cycle in which we’re 20 levels deep, 
and where, we aren’t really in control, 
we’re just avatars playing in their own private show. 
Can you imagine? Being merely a character on the screen of a gadget, 
part of a Sims game on some teenage alien boy’s futuristic tablet. 
Where algorithms don't need to render things we’re not looking at,  
where the chances of believing in the right God is pretty much zero, and that 
Faith is a construction we use to fill in the gaps,
where an “ever-expanding universe” keeps us stationed on this planet. 
The Greeks almost had it, they thought this life was a dream, 
it's like the ending to a bad story, a half-assed: “then he woke up, and none of it was real." 
What is reality anyway? Electrical impulses in our brain. 
What’s real is what we experience. Is there really more to be explained? 

If only I had the cheat codes to this virtual world, my personal cipher is all I would hack: 
make myself able to fall asleep at the drop of a hat.
