'Foundation' triggers interesting reflections on longtermism. 

The mathematics of psycho-history can predict future events based on the behaviour of human groups with incredible accuracy. One scientist brought the field to maturity and through psycho-historic calculations predicted that the Galactic Empire was decaying and that, if nothing would be done to stop it, the fall of the Empire would pit the galaxy into 30,000 years of chaos and barbarism. 

Through his calculations, he figures out a way to reduce this period of barbarism to a mere thousand through a centuries-long plan that begins with the establishment of two scientific Foundations at extreme opposing ends of the galaxy, at the very peripheries of the Empire. Everything was arranged in such a way that the future as foreseen by the unalterable mathematics of psycho-history would lead to their early isolation from the Empire and gradually grow into a new galactic empire - establishing a second, ultimate empire. 

His calculations told him that these Foundations would have to go through a series of crises before this, however. He died, and so far his calculations have been correct. The first book deals with the first two crises that were successfully overcome by one of the Foundations.

He never taught anyone else the science of psycho-history, or at least not deeply enough to get to his level of expertise. The field essentially died with him and no man since has been able to penetrate its intricacies. Meaning nobody has, or can, re-do his calculations and potentially try to change his plan (e.g. when the next crisis will be, which variables could influence that).

Essentially, he has locked-in a future based on his plans - or values! From where he stood, this was the right thing to do: the counterfactual would have been 30,000 years of suffering, as opposed to 1000 years based on his plan followed by a future of flourishing. 

But nobody can re-calculate this. What if another psycho-historian were to come up with different predictions? What if there were ways to reduce even the 'inevitable' thousand years? These questions aren't really dealt with in the book, but super interesting basis for discussion.
