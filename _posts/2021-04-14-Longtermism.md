A short piece on longtermism I wrote for an internship application in Spring 2021. I was to respond to one of the two prompts provided in no more than 60 minutes. This piece has not been edited since submitting the application. 

**Chosen prompt: Some argue that longtermism is not possible because you cannot know enough about the long-term effects of your actions to act with confidence. What do you think about that?**

It’s true that observing and measuring our long-run impact in advance is impossible - long-run consequences can only be estimated. For the foreseeable future, we will probably remain clueless about the long-run impacts of our actions. However, this does not mean that we should not try to shape the trajectory of the long-term future. 

The future is vast. There is potential for unimaginably rich conscious experience. Life in the universe may flourish for billions of years, making the expected value of the future astronomical. At the same time, it’s possible that the decisions we take today could shape the trajectory of future generations in non-trivial ways. Even very small actions today may have large consequences in the future, making even very small effects on the far future very important. For example, economic growth today can compound resources for the future. Or curing a child’s blindness can have positive ripple effects on the child’s happiness, but also on the education system and the economy (Beckstead, 2013). 

Because of the unknown consequences of our actions, we should try to ensure that we do not take irreversibly bad decisions. In daily life, we continuously adjust our plans in light of uncertainty and new information. We decide not to go on a day trip we had planned because of bad weather; we decide to delay our master’s degree because of a pandemic; we decide that we like our new flatmate because we’ve had multiple interesting interactions with them. In order to be able to similarly adjust our decisions on how to positively shape the trajectory of the long-run, we should continue to research and uncover the consequences of our decisions. In other words, we should try to uncover crucial considerations. 

Crucial considerations are ideas or information that might reveal the need for a major change of direction or priority. Acting before uncovering all the crucial considerations relevant to the decision is potentially disastrous because even one unknown consideration could entirely revise our conclusions (Griffes, 2018). Yet, while we want to reduce the likelihood of locking ourselves into suboptimal scenarios, not doing anything may also lock us in. Thus, at any given time, we act to the best of our knowledge, whether we think we’ve uncovered all the crucial considerations or not. The best we can do is act on best guesses based on current knowledge such that our actions remain corrigible. 

Through careful investigation of crucial considerations, delaying massive or “irreversible” decisions to future generations that have more knowledge, and only taking actions that we can correct over time means that we can meaningfully increase our confidence in the consequences of our actions. Thus, we can try to ensure that we’re not constantly and irreversibly victim to all unknown consequences.

Of course, many uncertainties remain. For example, will more knowledge really translate into better decision-making in the future? What if we remain clueless about the overall net impact of our actions? Do we have moral obligations towards future generations? The list goes on. Notwithstanding, it still seems valuable to avoid locking-in suboptimal states to realise the full potential benefit of the future.
