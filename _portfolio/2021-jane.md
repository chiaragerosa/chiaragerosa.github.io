My friend Max and I spent one full Sunday on this project, filming in the morning and editing in the afternoon. We didn't plan anything; we had no idea what we wanted to create or what story we wanted to tell. The idea was to film whatever we felt inspired to film in the moment, however random, and see whether we could give it meaning afterwards. Only once we had all the clips did we sit down and (attempt to) put a story to it. 

No fancy equipment, everything was shot on my Pixel. Sound effects were downloaded. All the background music is Max improvising on the piano.
