excerpt: 'This is a 3000-word paper I wrote during my masters for a module on International Peace and Security. The guiding question was: "What are the conditions under which the increased military use of information technology increases or decreases the risk of militarized interstate disputes?". The assignment was to conduct a literature review, develop a theoretical argument that allows for an empirical test and outline a feasible empirical research design to test the hypotheses.'

**Abstract**

The nature of cyberspace makes delegation of attacks from states to proxies increasingly attractive due to increases in plausible deniability. We first investigate the likely effects of this increase of uncertainty on militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) by surveying the literature on principal-agent theory and state-proxy relationships. We find that uncertainty likely encourages more proactive defence strategies, thereby increasing chances of conflict escalation. We posit that delegation of cyber attacks further exacerbates these effects, increasing the risk of MIDs, and propose a framework to empirically investigate our hypothesis and present future research avenues.
