excerpt: 'A video I created during my masters for a course on The Future of Conflict in a Digital Age. The task was to create a 5-10 minute vlog, introducing one of the concepts addressed in the course and explaining its relevance or potential role in advancing or reducing security or conflict. This is for a general audience with little background in new technologies and their associated key security, legal and ethical debates.'

Historically, natural pandemics have posed the greatest risk of mass global fatalities. The recent COVID-19 outbreak has reminded the world of the devastating effects of pandemic outbreaks, though one prominent theory falsely claimed that COVID-19 was engineered by China as a bioweapon. 

Conspiracies that COVID-19 was engineered by China as a bioweapon were proven false after investigations pinpointed an exotic meat market in Wuhan as the source of the virus. However, this theory is not outside the realm of possibility. But biological weapons are nothing new - a malicious assailant could use a biological agent to conduct coordinated and sophisticated attacks on key infrastructure, target areas of public health vulnerability or deliberately inflict harm on the population or particular segments of it. 

But just how serious is the threat of bioterrorism?
