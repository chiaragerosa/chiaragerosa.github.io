**Abstract**

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is hailed as having the potential to advance society in transformative ways. Yet, a growing number of states are leveraging advanced AI surveillance technology (AIST) not only to surveil, but also to repress citizens. Journalists, think tanks and academics alike fear that China, in particular, is advancing authoritarianism abroad by exporting advanced AIST to regimes with poor human rights records or illiberal forms of governance. Existing literature fails, however, to systematically investigate the relationship between China’s AIST exports and authoritarian practices in importing countries. This paper proposes a causal mechanism to investigate the effect of African governments’ adoption of China’s AIST on digital repression practices in Africa. Using two-way fixed effect regression, results demonstrate that adoption of Chinese AIST increases digital repression in Africa on only one of five digital repression indicators. Adoption of Chinese AIST is otherwise associated with a decrease of digital repression on the other four digital repression indicators. The findings suggest that AIST potentially reduces the need for digital repression, allowing us to critically assess the assumptions made in the causal mechanism as well as certain dynamics highlighted in the repression technology literature.
