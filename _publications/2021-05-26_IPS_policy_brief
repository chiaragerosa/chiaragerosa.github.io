**Executive Summary**

India and China share the longest disputed border in the world. Though it seems neither India nor China intend to spark a confrontation, each side perceives the activities of the other as threatening. As no third party enforces the defacto border, each side has incentives to renege. One side, therefore, responds to perceived border breaches by strengthening border security, leading the other to respond in kind. 

This brief is addressed to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Commitment problems occur when settlements preferable to war are unattainable. Pursuant to article 36 of the UN Charter, the recommendation is that the UNSC initiate a mediation process to facilitate an internationally recognized border settlement between India and China.
