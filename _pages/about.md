Hi, I'm Chiara. I'm a policy advisor working on UK AI regulation. 

Prior to that, I was a counter-disinformation policy adavisor, did some research at the intersection of AI and international security, and worked on improving collaborations between science and policy actors to contribute to the development of evidence-based policies. 

Aside from policy, I'm interested in solarpunk or fiction that explores questions of societal coordination and what it means to be human; and thinking about social dynamics and human relationships through the lens of evolutionary psychology.

I also enjoy cooking, swimming, mixing music, pole dance, muay thai, writing, raving and exploring with my friends. 

I grew up in Dubai, Bali and Hong Kong before doing a BSc in Political Science and International Relations at Universit√† Cattolica in Milan and an MSc in Security Studies at University College London.

This website aims to be a mix of professional and personal, to give you a full picture of who I am. But I admit - I don't keep it as up-to-date as I would like.
