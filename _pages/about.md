Hi, I'm Chiara. I'm excited about the future and want to contribute to making that future amazing for as many beings as possible. 

I'm currently a policy advisor focusing on the benefits and risks of AI on disinformation, as well as non-regulatory approaches to countering the spread of disinformation online. 

Prior to that, I worked on improving collaborations between science and policy actors to contribute to the development of evidence-based policies. 

Aside from policy, I'm interested in evolutionary psychology and like to think about and discuss social dynamics and human relationships.

I also enjoy cooking, swimming, boxing, writing up reflections and spending time dancing and exploring with loved ones. Recently, I've also picked up pole dance and mixing music.

I grew up in Dubai, Bali and Hong Kong before doing an undergrad in Political Science and International Relations at Universit√† Cattolica in Milan and a masters in Security Studies at University College London.
