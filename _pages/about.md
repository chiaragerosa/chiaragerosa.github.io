Hi, I'm Chiara. I'm a policy advisor working on security and online harms. 

Prior to that, I did some research on AI and international security and worked on improving collaborations between science and policy actors to contribute to the development of evidence-based policies. 

Aside from policy, I'm interested in evolutionary psychology and like to think about and discuss social dynamics and human relationships.

I also enjoy cooking, swimming, muay thai, writing, dancing and exploring with my friends. I've recently also picked up pole dancing and mixing music.

I grew up in Dubai, Bali and Hong Kong before doing a BSc in Political Science and International Relations at Universit√† Cattolica in Milan and an MSc in Security Studies at University College London.
