Hi, I'm Chiara. I'm a policy advisor working on UK AI regulation. 

Prior to that, I was a counter-disinformation policy advisor, did some research at the intersection of AI and international security, and worked on improving collaboration between academia and policy. 

I enjoy thinking and learning about many things. Most of this probably fits under the umbrellas of societal coordination, history, and evolution.

I grew up in Dubai, Bali and Hong Kong, before doing a BSc in Political Science and International Relations at Universit√† Cattolica in Milan, followed by an MSc in Security Studies at University College London.

When I'm not working, you can find me cooking, mixing music, pole dancing, writing, reading, raving, climbing. Not necessarily in that order. 

This website aims to be a mix of professional and personal. Blog posts are usually not polished. 

Views are my own - but also _very_ malleable.
